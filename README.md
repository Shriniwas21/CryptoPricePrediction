# Cryptocurrency Price Prediction Using Deep Learning

This project uses deep learning models such as **LSTM**, **GRU**, and **Transformer** to predict future cryptocurrency price movements using historical data.

## ğŸ“Š Dataset
- Source: [crypto.cs.iit.edu](https://crypto.cs.iit.edu) (manually downloaded)
- Data includes timestamped values for BTC, ETH, and other major tokens.

## ğŸ§  Models Implemented
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
- Transformer-based architecture

## ğŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics
- RMSE, MAE, MAPE
- Pearson Correlation and RÂ² for model interpretability

## ğŸ“Œ Key Highlights
- Visualizations of prediction trends
- Comparative analysis of model performance
- Simple UI for plotting trends

> ğŸ”§ Future: Adding ensemble averaging + sentiment-based models
